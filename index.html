                              Supercookies are similar to session <br>
                              cookies. However, they also have<br>
                              the ability to re-create user profiles,<br>
                              even after regular cookies have been<br>
                              deleted. Supercookies are also stored<br>
                              in different places than standard<br>
                              cookies. Supercookies are sometimes<br>
                              called "zombie cookies" or<br>
                              "evercookies."<br>

                              First-party cookies are cookies set by<br>

                              These cookies often store information<br>

                              such as embedded videos, ads, web<br>

                              often use third-party cookies to track<br>
